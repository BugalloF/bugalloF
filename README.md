- ðŸŒ± I finished Henry's Bootcamp on June 2022 and I'm always ready to learn new tecnologies.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about JavaScript, React, Redux, HTML, CSS, Node JS, Express, PostgreSQL, Sequelize.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I really enjoy work in groups with agile methologies.
- ðŸ“– I studied 3 years and a half Aeronautical Engenieering at Universidad Nacional de La Plata (2018-2022) before I decide to learn programming.

Projects 
</h3>
<p>
  During Henry's Bootcamp I made myself a Single Page App about PokÃ©mon.
  This is a fullstack app, that gives you the oportunity to search, filter, sort, create and delete a pokemon. <br/>
  Code: https://github.com/BugalloF/PI-Pokemons-Henry 
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  As fast as I approved my individual project, I started a grupal proyect wich is an marketplace for digital goods. 
  Also it has a follower system, likes system and logIn/Admin system. 
  It was an AMAZING experience to reach this project in three weeks only with six persons.
  This APP is deployed with Heroku and Vercel: <br/>
